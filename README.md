# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Data Analysis

A machine learning project predicting the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on health and lifestyle factors. The notebook demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation using Python.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project applies supervised learning to identify patterns associated with stroke risk using demographic and medical attributes.  
The workflow includes:
1. Data preprocessing and transformation  
2. Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
3. Model development using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
4. Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
